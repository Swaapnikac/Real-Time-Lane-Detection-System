# Real-Time Lane Detection System
**Deep Learning | Computer Vision | PyTorch | OpenCV | Image Processing**

A robust **lane detection model** built using **Python**, **OpenCV**, and **PyTorch**, capable of identifying lane lines in **real time** from a single front-facing camera — even on curved roads, under varying light, and complex geometries.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how **Deep Learning** and **Computer Vision** techniques can be combined to perform **real-time lane detection** for autonomous and driver-assist systems.  
It integrates classical image processing (grayscale conversion, Gaussian blur, Canny edge detection, perspective transform) with a **PyTorch-based neural model** for enhanced accuracy and generalization.

## Features

- Real-time lane detection from video or webcam feed  
- Works on **curved** and **straight** roads  
- Robust to **lighting variations** and **road noise**  
- Optimized with **NumPy vectorization** + GPU acceleration  
- Modular, extensible pipeline for research and experimentation
